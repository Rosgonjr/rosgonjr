    <p>My name is Rosbitt. I am a student in Utah with a big interest in digital design. I work on Locker Number Magazine working on design, writing articles, and the videography portion of LNMag. I am also the social media “director“ managing the magazine Twitter. My other main interest outside of school is skateboarding. I am a sponsored skateboarder thanks to Salty Peaks Board Shop and I intern at Gold Coast Longboards doing research and development. I film many skating events and edit them and publish them under our teams YouTube. In the future I would like to study industrial design and engineering and work on projects of the future.<br>
